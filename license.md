this is anti-asshole software, released for free use by individuals and organizations that do not navigate through the world by means of being a prick. to be frank, this remains purposely vague, since there are countless ways in which asshole-ness can manifest. i.e. an asshole has probably not even considered looking at the license, or if they are a more socially aware asshole (likely a *bigger* asshole) they probably presently scoffing or rolling their eyes while reading this. to both of the aforementioned groups, and the rest of the assholes, i say **fuck you**. my shitty software, not yours. everyone else is welcome to my shit.
