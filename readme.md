# GRY

GRY is a unitary CSS framework. created by me, for me.

### WTF does that mean?
it means that it was created with the following principles in mind:
1) 1:12 scale
2) mobile-first
3) monism
4) the golden ratio
5) utility classes

### how to use
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com//gry.min.css">
```

## development

### requirements
gry is developed and built on a macOS machine, to fork or compile on your own it requires:
- deno
- typescript

### how it works
pretty simple. the `css` folder has a bunch of different css files. this is where you would go in and edit whatever you wanted to change. these files will be minified by the [minifier](https://deno.land/x/minifier@v1.1.1) deno module after being looped over by the `build.ts` file.

### license
GRY is free to be utilized by individuals and organizations that are not assholes, by my discretion. for more information, check out the super legit and official [licensing](license.md) document.
